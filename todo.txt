set up gitlab


global game:
    ✅ build hp
    ✅ make hud for hp
    ✅ make hud array at the top with what badGuys are coming, they are clickable
    clickable buttons:
        ✅ make hud for buy ables
        make buttons with info about its entity
        ✅ put entity when mouse click -> add it to the good guy pool
    action mode
    clickable entities:
        ✅ output on screen
        ✅ output next to the entity
        when multiple entites click put a ui to select which one you mean
    money
    hover over stat to see where bonus's come from
    if sats are off screen, draw them on screen somehow

goodGuy:
    sprite
    ✅ range
    ✅different types of targeting methods created:
        ✅ fix: goodGuys need to reset when something exits OR enters their range depending on their targeting method
    UI buttons for switching targetingmethod
    cost for each ability
    abilities:
        that slows badGuys for a few seconds
        tesla coil - hits aoe
        extra damage
    add getting money back when sold
    animation to move guy back to wallet when sold

badGuy:
    sprites
    ✅ when reach the end of the map decrement global hp
    ✅ spawn timer so they dont come out at the same time
    move cooldown
    ability cooldown
    abilities:
        that heals itself overTime
        heals others
        speeds others (around it or maybe target)
        minus damage
    add number of bad Guys next to circles

items:
    sprites
    implement something??
    items UI, what possible items can be dropped and their percents, similar to tf2 crates

bugs:
    ✅ badguys ids are duping
    ✅ spawn time still goes even if not in play mode, make a world variable that starts counting when his play and use that instead
    action timer still goes even when game is paused, resulting in slow shooting towers to reload during the pause
    ✅ fix off centered drawing
    ✅ badGuys restarting path too early?
    ✅ cooldown is getting called even tower doesnt fire, resets when calling canDoAction, not on action
